            The lottery process starts with players purchasing tickets from
            authorized retailers or online platforms. Each ticket has a unique
            set of numbers, either chosen by the player or randomly generated.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            On the designated draw date, a public drawing occurs where a series
            of winning numbers are randomly selected. This is usually done with
            machines that mix and draw numbered balls or through computerized
            random number generators, ensuring the process is fair and
            transparent.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            After the drawing, players check their tickets against the winning
            numbers. This can be done at retail locations, online, or via
            official lottery apps. Matching tickets are identified as winners,
            with the prize amount depending on how many numbers match and the
            lotteryâ€™s specific rules.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Winners must then claim their prizes within a set timeframe,
            presenting their winning tickets for validation. Small prizes can
            often be claimed at retail locations, while larger prizes may
            require a visit to a lottery office or submission through official
            channels. Payouts are typically made as lump sums or annuities, and
            taxes may be deducted.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Unclaimed prizes, if not collected within the specified period, are
            usually redirected to future lottery draws, special promotions, or
            community programs. Lotteries are closely regulated to maintain
            integrity, with proceeds often funding public services such as
            education, infrastructure, and charitable initiatives.
